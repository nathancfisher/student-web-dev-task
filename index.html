            unique, and taking time for yourself to explore the city, settle

            There's no pressure to go to clubs, drink, do sports etc... you can

              Sheffield Students’ Union exists to ensure you have an outstanding
              experience during your time as a student at the University of
              Sheffield. We’re a sister organisation to the University, but
              independent of it. All University of Sheffield students are
              automatically members of our union, which gives them access to our
              support, communities, representation, entertainment, activities
              and facilities. We’ve been the heart and soul of student life
              since we began in 1906, and value being inclusive, impactful, and
              famously friendly! We’re also a charity which means the money you
              spend here goes back into supporting students!

              Welcome Week (AKA Freshers Week) is a week dedicated to helping
              you settle into student life. It showcases opportunities you can
              get involved in, runs activities, events, and fantastic nights to
              enjoy, and helps you start your student life on the right track.
              Our fairs are free and there will be lots of freebies to grab
              throughout the week. Don’t worry if you miss any of it though, as
              it’s never too late to get involved. The fun continues throughout
              the year!

              Beware of fake official freshers events. Unscrupulous promoters
              often set up Freshers events and chat groups, pretending to be
              part of the Official University of Sheffield Freshers Week. The
              University of Sheffield Students’ Union is the only organisation
              to run the Official University of Sheffield Freshers Nights Out.
              You can only get tickets for these events through our Students’
              Union and Foundry website (with the expectation of our new
              Leadmill Fridays!). Our events take place inside the Students’
              Union venues, where you can expect one of the best and safest
              nights out in Sheffield.

              It’s natural to feel anxious about starting as a new student as
              there’s a lot of change to navigate. The good news is that you’ll
              find lots of friendly students and staff ready to welcome and help
              you on arrival and throughout your first few weeks. Most new
              students will be feeling the same so don’t be afraid to say hi! We
              along with the University have a wide variety of activities on
              offer, designed to appeal to different interests and needs. We try
              to make sure our activities are as accessible as possible. Our
              Welcome fairs have quiet hours, free ear plugs, and extra quiet
              rooms so you can take a break when you need it. We hope our events
              will help you meet new people, but don’t worry if you don’t make
              lifelong friendships in your first week. There are plenty of
              opportunities to meet new people and join in activities throughout
              the year!
