                  learning! There's no pressure to go to clubs, drink, do sports
                  etc... you can experience university at your own pace!'

                  Sheffield Students’ Union exists to ensure you have an
                  outstanding experience during your time as a student at the
                  University of Sheffield. We’re a sister organisation to the
                  University, but independent of it. All University of Sheffield
                  students are automatically members of our union, which gives
                  them access to our support, communities, representation,
                  entertainment, activities and facilities. We’ve been the heart
                  and soul of student life since we began in 1906, and value
                  being inclusive, impactful, and famously friendly! We’re also
                  a charity which means the money you spend here goes back into
                  supporting students!

                  Welcome Week (AKA Freshers Week) is a week dedicated to
                  helping you settle into student life. It showcases
                  opportunities you can get involved in, runs activities,
                  events, and fantastic nights to enjoy, and helps you start
                  your student life on the right track. Our fairs are free and
                  there will be lots of freebies to grab throughout the week.
                  Don’t worry if you miss any of it though, as it’s never too
                  late to get involved. The fun continues throughout the year!

                  Beware of fake official freshers events. Unscrupulous
                  promoters often set up Freshers events and chat groups,
                  pretending to be part of the Official University of Sheffield
                  Freshers Week. The University of Sheffield Students’ Union is
                  the only organisation to run the Official University of
                  Sheffield Freshers Nights Out. You can only get tickets for
                  these events through our Students’ Union and Foundry website
                  (with the expectation of our new Leadmill Fridays!). Our
                  events take place inside the Students’ Union venues, where you
                  can expect one of the best and safest nights out in Sheffield.

                  It’s natural to feel anxious about starting as a new student
                  as there’s a lot of change to navigate. The good news is that
                  you’ll find lots of friendly students and staff ready to
                  welcome and help you on arrival and throughout your first few
                  weeks. Most new students will be feeling the same so don’t be
                  afraid to say hi! We along with the University have a wide
                  variety of activities on offer, designed to appeal to
                  different interests and needs. We try to make sure our
                  activities are as accessible as possible. Our Welcome fairs
                  have quiet hours, free ear plugs, and extra quiet rooms so you
                  can take a break when you need it. We hope our events will
                  help you meet new people, but don’t worry if you don’t make
                  lifelong friendships in your first week. There are plenty of
                  opportunities to meet new people and join in activities
                  throughout the year!
